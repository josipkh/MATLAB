# Vehicle dynamics control using dimensionless MPC
This repository contains the code associated with my Master's thesis, which can be found [here](https://odr.chalmers.se/server/api/core/bitstreams/cd315c19-429e-4e97-9f82-f6082575e2ec/content).

The simulation requires [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) and [OSQP](https://osqp.org/) and can be run in MATLAB using the `MPC_YALMIP_PI_optimizer.m` script.
